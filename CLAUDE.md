# Working in this repo — Convert (unit-converter)

This app is a unit converter, world clock / meeting planner and quick-reference
tables for immediately.run. Entry: `src/App.tsx`; conversion, parsing and
time-zone logic under `src/lib/`; unit and reference tables under `src/data/`;
preferences persist through `src/lib/store.ts` (private settings mount only,
in-memory fallback). No external network calls; `Intl` only for dates.

## Hard rules (these break immediately.run if violated)

1. **`src/App.tsx` is the entry point.** immediately.run renders its **default
   export**. `src/main.tsx` is for local dev/build only and is **ignored** at
   runtime — never put CSS imports, providers, or app logic there.
2. **Import global CSS from `App.tsx`**, not from `main.tsx`. Anything the
   rendered tree needs (CSS, context providers) must be reachable from
   `App.tsx`.
3. **A file that exports a React component exports ONLY components.** No mixing a
   component with named exports of data/constants/helpers. (`interface`/`type`
   are erased at compile time and are fine.) This is the React Fast Refresh rule;
   `npm run lint` enforces it. Put data in `src/data/`, hooks in `src/hooks/`,
   utilities in `src/lib/`.
4. **One component per file, default-exported**, named for what it renders.
5. **CSS lives in `.css` files imported from TypeScript** — not in giant
   `<style>` blocks or inline `style={{}}` for the bulk of styling.
6. **Fonts via CSS `@import`** as the first line of the CSS file, not `<link>`
   tags in `index.html`.
7. **Import local assets** (`import logo from './assets/logo.png'`); don't
   reference server paths that won't exist in the sandbox.
8. **No Node / build-time-only APIs** in the rendered tree — it runs in a browser
   iframe. `document`, `window`, and `fetch` are available. **`localStorage` is
   not**: apps run at an opaque origin (a sandboxed iframe without
   `allow-same-origin`), where even *reading* the property throws
   `SecurityError` — so wrap every access in `try`/`catch` (a
   `typeof localStorage === 'undefined'` guard does NOT work, because the throw
   is on access, not on the value) and never touch it at module scope. Treat
   persistence as optional and keep the app fully usable without it. Worked
   example: `src/hooks/useTheme.ts`.
9. **MDX is only for long-form prose** (articles, guides). Structured/repeated
   data stays as typed arrays in `src/data/`. If you add `.mdx`, the Vite plugin
   and `src/mdx.d.ts` shim are already wired up.

## Loading & caching on immediately.run

`.github/workflows/cache.yml` publishes a pre-cached zip of this repo to its own
GitHub Pages on each push to `main`, so immediately.run loads fast and within
anonymous rate limits. To enable it on a repo in your own account/org, turn Pages
on once — **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions** — then push to `main`; no
tokens or secrets. (immediately-run org repos self-provision Pages on the first
run via the org's internal deploy GitHub App, which external repos don't have and
don't need — `cache.yml` falls back to the manual step for them.) Don't move the
cache to a different path or hostname — the client discovers it by convention at
`https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/cached_repositories/main.zip`.

`"immediately.run": { "requireLatest": "..." }` in `package.json` controls
freshness. It is a **string enum**, not a boolean: `"stale_ok"` (always serve
the cache, fastest, offline-friendly), `"optimistic"` (the default — serve
cache, check in background), or `"strict"` (always run the newest commit, at
the cost of a freshness check on launch). Leave it unset unless
to-the-commit freshness matters; the default is fast and works offline.

## Design system

This brand is: cool near-black canvas · magenta↔violet signature gradient ·
Gabarito display type · Space Mono details · hairline borders · hard-offset hover
shadows · sentence case · headlines end on a period · **no emoji**. Dark is the
default; a light theme is wired via `data-theme="light"` on `<html>`.

- **Pull tokens from `src/index.css`** (`--bg`, `--panel`, `--ink`, `--accent`,
  `--grad`, `--r-lg`, `--shadow-card`, the type families, etc.) instead of
  hard-coding colors, radii, or fonts.
- Apply the signature gradient to text with `className="grad-text"`.
- For icons beyond the unicode set (`→ ★ ● ☀ ☾`), use
  [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) at 16–24px, `currentColor`. No emoji.

## Finding the SDK API (read this before guessing imports)

Everything the platform offers comes from `@immediately-run/sdk`. Don't guess
export names or signatures — look them up. The package ships full API docs,
fetchable in one request and optimized for both humans and coding agents:

- **`llms.txt`** — <https://immediately-run.github.io/immediately-run-sdk/llms.txt> —
  a concise map of every export grouped by module, with its kind, import path,
  and a one-line description. **Start here.**
- **`api.json`** — <https://immediately-run.github.io/immediately-run-sdk/api.json> —
  the complete TypeDoc model (exact signatures, parameters, types) when you need
  more than the one-liners.
- **HTML reference** — <https://immediately-run.github.io/immediately-run-sdk/> —
  human-browsable.

Once installed, `node_modules/@immediately-run/sdk` ships `.d.ts` carrying the
same JSDoc, so your editor/agent reads the typed API inline with no network. All
exports are importable from the package root (`@immediately-run/sdk`) or a
per-module subpath (`@immediately-run/sdk/hooks`).

## Platform security model (what your app can and can't do)

Your app runs in a **sandboxed iframe with an opaque origin**. The rules below
follow from that and from the platform capability model
(`docs/specs/UI_AS_APPS_SPEC.md` §8 in the docs repo). Violations don't just
break your app — calls fail with typed errors, and trying to work around them
reads as hostile. (Enforcement is rolling out per the spec's §10 ladder —
items 4, 6 and 8 describe machinery that is specified but not yet live; write
new code as if they're enforced and it will keep working as they land.)

1. **All platform interaction goes through `@immediately-run/sdk`.** There is
   no other channel: no shared storage with other apps, no reaching sibling
   iframes, no postMessage of your own to the parent.
2. **Never handle user credentials.** You will never see the user's GitHub
   token, API keys, or any secret — sign-in and privileged actions are
   host-driven. Call protocol methods reactively, gated on
   `getAuthState().status === 'signed-in'`; never store or request tokens.
3. **The filesystem you see is the filesystem you got.** Mounts the host gives
   you (your app's spaces, granted folders) are your whole world — outside
   paths don't exist, and a grant may be read-only. Don't probe for escapes
   (`..`, absolute paths); writes to read-only mounts fail with `EROFS`.
4. **Access to more data is asked for, not taken.** Need another space or
   folder? Call the SDK request method and the *user* picks in host UI. Expect
   `{ ok: false, code: 'cancelled' | 'forbidden' }` and handle it gracefully.
5. **Handle typed errors everywhere.** Platform calls reply
   `{ ok: false, code, message }` (`forbidden`, `auth-required`, `cancelled`,
   `invalid-params`, …). `forbidden` means your app lacks that capability —
   that's policy, not a bug to retry around.
6. **Declare what you invoke and provide.** Cross-app tasks go in
   `package.json` under `"immediately.run"`: `"invokes"` for task contracts
   you call, `"provides"` for ones you implement. Undeclared invocations are
   rejected.
7. **Don't imitate host chrome.** Never render fake sign-in prompts, consent
   dialogs, or the platform's seam/header UI. The host draws those; imitations
   are treated as spoofing.
8. **If you embed an LLM agent, its tool list is your catalog.** Use the
   SDK-provided method catalog as the agent's tools — it is pre-filtered to
   your app's grants, so the agent can't exceed what your app may do. Don't
   hand-roll tools that shell around the SDK.
9. **Expect cancellation and absence.** Interactive flows can resolve
   `cancelled`; capabilities can be absent on a fork of your app. Degrade
   features, don't crash.

## Editing: delegate to the platform editor

**Your app's default text/code/file editing experience is the platform editor,
not a bespoke in-app editor.** When the thing the user edits *is* a file (a
Markdown/MDX note, a JSON config, a source module, a CSV), hand that file to the
platform's editing surface instead of shipping your own `<textarea>` or code
editor. This is the same instinct as not reimplementing sign-in or PR review:
there is already a good, forkable, mobile-capable, agent-readable editor — use it.
(Full rationale and the proposed platform additions are in
`docs/specs/EDITOR_FIRST_EDITING_SPEC.md`.)

1. **Edit a file in one of your mounts via the `edit-file` task.** Delegate a
   capability for exactly that one file; the host opens the editor and tears the
   delegation down when done. No consent prompt — you're narrowing a grant you
   already hold:
   ```ts
   import { invokeTask, capFile } from '@immediately-run/sdk';
   await invokeTask('edit-file', {
     file: capFile({ mountId: 'space:abc', relPath: 'notes/idea.mdx' }, { mode: 'rw' }),
   });
   ```
   This is exactly how the whiteboard's "Open source" button works.
2. **Offer "edit" as an affordance on the item, not a mode of your app.** Select
   an object / focus a row → an edit icon that opens *that* file. Keep your
   run-mode UI free of editor chrome (run-mode comes first).
3. **Gate the affordance on writability.** Show it only when the mount is `rw`;
   re-evaluate on `onMountsChange` and hide it on a role downgrade. Never show a
   button that comes back `read-only`/`forbidden`, and never surface `EROFS` as UX.
4. **A few typed fields is a form, not an editor.** An inspector that sets a
   color, tags, or a lock toggle should be inline UI. Reach for the platform
   editor for the free-form body / the whole file.
5. **Build a real in-app editor only with a stated reason** — the content isn't a
   file the platform editor can edit (freehand drawing, a node graph,
   direct-manipulation geometry), or a measured UX need the platform editor can't
   meet. Write the reason down; convenience is not a reason.
6. **Known gaps (don't paper over them with a `<textarea>`):** an app running in
   *present* mode can't yet summon the edit experience on its **own source**, and
   opening a specific mounted file in the *main* editor (vs. the `edit-file`
   overlay) from a standalone app isn't supported yet. Both are specified as
   proposed deltas in `EDITOR_FIRST_EDITING_SPEC.md` §6; until they land, rely on
   the `edit-file` task and the host's edit experience rather than rolling your own.

## Verify before you're done

```bash
npm run build   # must pass with no type errors
npm run lint    # must pass — this is the cheapest proof the Fast Refresh rule holds
```

Then eyeball the page (`npm run dev`) and click any interactive controls.

## Debugging on immediately.run (not just `vite dev`)

`vite dev` proves your app renders, but the failure mode this whole file warns about
— *"works locally, breaks on immediately.run"* — only shows up **running inside the
host**: the sandboxed iframe, the SDK channel, the capability gate. Debug there too.

- **Drive a real browser with Chrome DevTools MCP.** The `mcp__chrome-devtools__*`
  tools navigate the page, take an accessibility **snapshot** (element `uid`s to
  click/fill), run JS with **`evaluate_script`**, and read the **console** +
  **network** — which is where SDK `{ ok: false, code }` replies and sandbox errors
  actually surface. Reproduce, then `list_console_messages` /
  `list_network_requests`; don't guess from the rendered DOM alone.
- **Run your app *on the host*, with no commit, via the `local` provider.** Mount
  your working tree into the real host and edit live:
  ```bash
  immediately.run dev . --origin https://local.immediately.run --json
  # → open the printed /edit/local/<name>-<hash8>/.../live#ir-endpoint=…&ir-token=… link
  ```
  Edits on disk hot-reload in the host preview, so you exercise the *real* SDK +
  capability path (consent prompts, `forbidden`, mounts) instead of a local stub. A
  dev-served app gets a **fresh appKey** with no prior grants — handy for testing
  your first-run consent flow honestly. (`@immediately-run/cli`, Node ≥ 18, git
  repo.)
- **Always use `https://local.immediately.run`, never `localhost`** — config is
  keyed by hostname and only the `*.immediately.run` origin is fully wired
  (sandbox + backend + auth allowlist).
- **A passkey / Touch-ID prompt can't be automated** — the first secret unseal or
  sign-in raises a native dialog; hand that step to a human, or reload after it's
  cached.
